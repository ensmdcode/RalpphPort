	I have learned a lot of lessons this quarter especially the use of CSS in websites. From what i've been doing I find that CSS is a much shorter and simpler way in doing websites. Although some of the new concepts are a bit hard to understand, it is still fun using them because it challenges me. I also enjoyed mixing and adding the concepts from the first quarter to the second quarter. Thank You very much for spending time reading the contents of my E-Portfolio!
